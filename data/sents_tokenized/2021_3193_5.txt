Multisensor and multiscale dataobtained by means of seismic sparker , sub - bottom profiler chirp , multibeam , side scan sonar , diving , and uncrewed aerial vehiclesmade it possible to reconstruct the morphological features shaped during the LGM at depths between 125 and 135 m . In particular , tectonic controlled palaeo - cliffs affected by landslides , the mouth of a deep palaeo - valley fossilized by marine sediments and a palaeo - lagoon containing a peri - littoral thanatocenosis ( 18 , 983 268 cal BP ) were detected .

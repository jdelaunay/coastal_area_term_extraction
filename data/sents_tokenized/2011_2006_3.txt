Little effect on total or relative cell abundance or bulk bacterial production was observed after 6 or 24 h exposure to 7.5 nM of the 3 different PUAs for the different bacterial phylogenetic groups (Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Rhodobacteraceae and SAR11), assessed by catalysed reporter deposition (CARD)-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).

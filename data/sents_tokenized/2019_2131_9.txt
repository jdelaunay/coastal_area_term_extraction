The town - levels population NTL simulation model is built ( R2 = 0 . 43 , N = 47 ) for the first time in PRE with mean relative error ( MSE ) of 32 % ( N = 24 , town level ) , On the other side , the tsunami hazard map was produced based on numerical modeling of potential tsunami wave height and velocity , combining with the river net system , elevation , slope , and vegetation cover factors .

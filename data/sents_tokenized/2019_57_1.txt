Recent sediment records collected from the inner Abra of Bilbao bay were examined using a multidisciplinary approach including geochemical , micropaleontological and isotopic proxies to evaluate heavy metal contamination ( Pb , Zn and Cd ) , ecological condition ( benthic foraminifera ) , and sediment accumulation variability ( 210Pb ) .

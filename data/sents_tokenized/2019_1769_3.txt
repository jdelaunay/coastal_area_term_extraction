The analyses revealed that with increasing temperature , both the mean floc diameter and floc volume grew , while the maximum floc diameter initially increased and then slightly decreased with its peak at 10 C . During settling , the SSC change rate was exponentially related to the SSC , with an optimal fitting index of 0 . 3 .

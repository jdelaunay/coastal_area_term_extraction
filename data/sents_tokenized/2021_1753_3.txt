In this study , species - specific quantitative real - time PCR assays ( qPCR ) ( SYBR Green I ) targeting the mitochondrial 16S rDNA ( mt - 16S rDNA ) of jellyfish were developed and were used to estimate the distribution and seasonal fluctuations of four jellyfish species ( Nemopilema nomurai , Cyanea nozakii , Rhopilema esculentum , and Aurelia coerulea ) in Jiaozhou Bay ( JZB ) , China in 2013 .

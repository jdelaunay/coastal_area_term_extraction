The patterns of relative concentrations and types of PAHs observed and knowledge of the potential sources, as well as the results of a principal component analysis, are consistent with the primary sources of PAHs in sediments of the northern Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, being derived from the high-temperature pyrolytic processes such as combustion of fossil fuel.

To further understand how fish reductions change feeding patterns of fish , we studied the diets of small - to medium - sized roach ( Rutilus rutilus ) and European perch ( Perca fluviatilis ) on a monthly basis using gut - content analysis during an 18 - month period before and after a whole - lake fish removal in a eutrophic shallow lake .

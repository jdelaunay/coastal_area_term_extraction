Model applications under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario ( RCP 8 . 5 ) , accounting for forcing uncertainties , show that while the Type 1 STI will not change type over the twenty - first century , the Type 2 inlet may change into a more unstable Type 3 system around mid - century , and the Type 3 STI may change into a less unstable Type 2 system in about 20 years from now , further changing into a stable Type 1 STI around mid - century .

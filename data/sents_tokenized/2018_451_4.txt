Within this framework , we ( 1 ) quantify the present value of coastal ecosystem services by using economic valuation techniques ; ( 2 ) identify the potential impacts of relative sea level rise ( RSLR ) - induced inundation on ecosystem services ( for the year 2100 inundation scenarios ) ; and ( 3 ) monetize these impacts by developing a novel scenario - based approach .

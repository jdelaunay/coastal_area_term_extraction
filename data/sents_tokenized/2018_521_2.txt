To investigate the distribution and removal of ARGs in WWTPs , a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant ( PWWTP ) and an integrated wastewater treatment plant ( IWWTP ) in a fine - chemical industrial park were chosen , and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and real - time PCR techniques were used to determine the occurrence and abundances of ARGs along the treatment processes .

This is accomplished by 1) detailed logging of sedimentary facies, 2) applying functional morphological reconstructions of echinoid skeletons and interpreting their behaviour and life habits, 3) quantifying various taphonomic features of test preservation, and 4) analysing accompanying fauna and flora.The Funtanazza section is dominated by fine- and coarse-grained siliciclastic lithologies.

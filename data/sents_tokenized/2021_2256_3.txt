Electrical conductivity was measured from 300 soil samples collected at the study area ; this , together with elevation , distance to river , Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) , Salinity Index ( SI ) , and Soil - Adjusted Vegetation Index ( SAVI ) , was used to build the salinity model using a multiple regression analysis .

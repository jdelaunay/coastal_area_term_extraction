In 2009, elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) occurred in the coastal plume, where submarine groundwater discharge contributed DIC and TA additions of 38.920.5 and 42.522.3 mol kg1, respectively, with a DIC/TA ratio of 0.92, which made a minor contribution to the variation of seawater partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH and the aragonite saturation state index (arag).

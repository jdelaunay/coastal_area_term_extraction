After reviewing all published data sources, we report that the density of bearded seals in Canada were highest (and highly variable) in the Beaufort Sea (0.018.68 seals*km2), then in Baffin Bay-Davis Strait (0.0048.3 seals*km2), and lowest and less variable inter-annually in the Hudson Complex (0.02 to 0.12 seals*km2) at the time of these surveys.

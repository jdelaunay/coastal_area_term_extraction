It brought to light the absence of a ground-validated subsidence study; a non-identification of potential local subsidence drivers; a non-availability of a subsidence-infused coastal vulnerability assessment; non-existing studies on the combined effects of climate change and subsidence; and huge deficits in available data for numerical modelling of coastal subsidence.

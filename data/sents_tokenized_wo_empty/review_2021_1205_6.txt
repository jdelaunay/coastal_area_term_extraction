This review study indicates: (i) geohazards of different phases and geohazard chain are generally triggered by both early-phase tectonics-dominated and later-phase sedimentation-dominated processes; (ii) the fault geometric and stress segmentation may have played an important role in controlling on the uneven and asymmetric distribution of earthquakes and submarine canyons of the northern SCS, Especially, the ENE-striking preexisting Littoral Fault Zone is the major seismogenic structure along the Southchina coastline; (iii) the tectono-sedimentary coupling induced landslide and slope failure that has help to shape the modern coastal and slope geomorphology.

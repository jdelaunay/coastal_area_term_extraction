High-precipitation-high-wind-storm events produced NOx concentrations significantly lower than other types of storms (e.g., low-precipitation-high-wind, high-wind-low-precipitation, low-wind-low-precipitation), which likely results in relatively low DNF rates by flooded habitats and low removal percentages of total dissolved nitrogen loads.

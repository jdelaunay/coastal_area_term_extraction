Through comparison of the calculated masses remaining over time in the aquifer using the proposed semi-analytical solution under two types of variable boundary conditions (Dirichlet-Neumann and Cauchy-Neumann variable boundary conditions), we found that the Cauchy-Neumann variable boundary conditions reflected reality better than did the Dirichlet-Neumann variable boundary conditions.

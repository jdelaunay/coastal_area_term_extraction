These criteria include (1) limited influence of wind and waves on the depositional environment, (2) lack of significant freshwater influence and therefore any persistent brackish environments, (3) a distinct spatial distribution of microenvironments defined by substrate and exposure period, (4) high diversity of epichnial traces directly associated with microenvironments across the tidal flat, (5) generally low degree of reworking of traces by bioturbation but high degree of reworking by tidal currents, and (6) preservation of traces of predation and scavenging behavior on an exposed surface.

Metabolic activity, i.e. singlecell activity as determined by microautoradiography combined with CARD-FISH (MAR-CARDFISH), was least affected by the addition of single PUAs in Gammaproteobacteria, markedly in Bacteroidetes and most markedly in Rhodobacteraceae, leading to a decrease in Rhodobacteraceae abundance by 21% (by 38% of the active cells assessed by leucine uptake) compared to the control.

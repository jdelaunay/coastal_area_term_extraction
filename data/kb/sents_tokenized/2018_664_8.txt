From the dry to wet seasons, the maximum decrease in the amplitude of the dominant M2 tide is approximately 0.3 m. The amplitudes of the tidal constituents do not decrease monotonically because of the complex interactions among the bed friction, river discharge and channel width convergence as well as energy transmission between the tidal constituents.

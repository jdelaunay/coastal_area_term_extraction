Guided by the identified knowledge and data gaps and the need to mitigate impacts, the study recommends a thorough assessment of rSLR and vulnerability; a continuous and long-term monitoring framework for rSLR and its drivers; a hybrid approach and review of coastal management strategies; and the reinforcement of conservational laws and conventions to avert the increasing vulnerability of Ghana's coast.

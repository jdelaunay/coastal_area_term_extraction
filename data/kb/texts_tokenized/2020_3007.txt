2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.Marine macroalgae, or seaweeds, are plant-like organisms that generally live attached to rock or other hard substrata in coastal areas.
They belong to three different groups, empirically distinguished since the mid-nineteenth century on the basis of thallus color: brown algae (phylum Ochrophyta, class Phaeophyceae), red algae (phylum Rhodophyta), and green algae (phylum Chlorophyta, classes Bryopsidophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dasycladophyceae, Prasinophyceae, and Ulvophyceae).
Red algae are a low level form of thallus plants that have no leaves, roots and true stems, mostly growing on rocks in coral reefs.
Red algae contain organic compounds such as polysaccharides, vitamins, as well as other bioactive compounds.
In addition, they contain phytohormones which potentially can be used as a biostimulant in fertilizer application.
Although the exact physiological roles remain to be elucidated, the essential and bioactive forms of five old timer phytohormones such as auxin, ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinins, and gibberellins have been detected in red algae.
Our recent investigation identified auxin, cytokinins and gibberellins from red algae (Gracilaria coronopifolia and Eucheuma cotonii) and investigated their effects on the growth of rice (Oryza sativa).
Trans-zeatin (cytokinin) from G. coronopifolia was 6.26 10-2 mg/g dry weight, while indole acetic acid (auxin) and GA3 (gibberellin) from E. cotonii was 5.34 10-3 and 1.32 mg/g dry weight, respectively.

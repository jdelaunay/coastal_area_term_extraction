The cysticercoid stage of the bird tapeworm Flamingolepis liguloides was studied.
It was observed in 11 populations of the intermediate host Artemia (Crustacea, Anostraca).
A relationship between the prevalence of the parasite in Artemia and the population density of flamingoes Phoenicopterus ruber on the sites studied is shown.
Parasitism in the infected host populations increases with the size of Artemia.

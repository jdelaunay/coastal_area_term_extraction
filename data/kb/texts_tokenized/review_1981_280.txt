In the Soviet Union coastal protective works are undertaken along the coasts of the Black Sea, Azov Sea, Baltic Sea, Pacific Ocean and also along the coasts of large lakes and reservoirs.
As a result of continuous reduction in the longshore drift of sediments due to increased development activities along coasts, and dams and waterways in rivers, there is considerable erosion of the beaches.
Many coastal areas are attacked by storm waves.
Submerged breakwaters and beach nourishment programmes dominate the coastal engineering works in the Soviet Union.

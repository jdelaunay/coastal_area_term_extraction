Inshore marine areas host key habitats for the biological cycle of many marine populations, but are subject to strong anthropogenic pressure.
Uses of inshore areas are multiple and often give rise to conflicting interests.
In this context, marine protected areas (MPAs) and artificial reefs (ARs) are increasingly regarded as interesting management measures, in that they contribute to ecosystem conservation, fisheries sustainability, and because they can be helpful in zoning coastal areas in order to reduce conflicts between users.
Beyond these expected benefits, it is important to appraise whether MPAs and ARs meet managers' objectives.
This review focuses on the interaction between ecological sciences and management in the purpose of establishing or monitoring MPAs and ARs.
We first study how objectives have to be formalized through management plans, and which kinds of information need to be collected in this respect.
We then report management objectives related to MPAs and ARs, and list corresponding observed effects.
Finally, we discuss the present role of monitoring and scientific research in the management process and propose a few perspectives for scientific research.

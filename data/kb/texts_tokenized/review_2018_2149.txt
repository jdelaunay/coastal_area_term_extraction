Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper is to review how to investigate the interactions between groundwater and seawater.
Those interactions divide into two, which are submarine groundwater discharge and seawater intrusion.
This investigation is important because the interactions can give impact to coastal aquifer and marine ecosystem.
On land, fresh groundwater is vulnerable to seawater disturbance.
Coastal aquifer is under pressure from abstraction caused by population, industry, and agriculture.
The pumping can induce seawater intrusion and land subsidence.
Then in marine, seawater mixes with freshwater and it decreases salinity.
Low salinity will influence marine ecosystem.
The ecosystem will be disturbed by groundwater discharge if that water is contaminated.
Based on the argue investigation of groundwater-seawater interactions is important and must be accurate because the results are used for coastal water management.
To investigate the interactions data, i.e., lithology, pumping tests, hydrochemical data, sea level rise estimates, precipitation data, geophysics, environmental isotopes, and drilling information, should be compiled.
The interaction can feed a model to determine how much groundwater extraction happening on coastal areas to prevent seawater intrusion and land subsidence.
Water resources management on coasts should consider groundwater-seawater interactions.

The multidisciplinary research project "GIZCAM" began in January 2006 and will last 3 years, coordinating several research axes in order to promote Integrated Coastal Zone Management.
It is scheduled to finalize a simulation model of the "Ile de Camargue" (Rhone Delta central area) hydrological functioning; to make it more modular in order to integrate new hydraulic management options, in normal (agricultural drainage) or critical (river floods and sea storms) situation.
This tool is based in particular on data generated by a GIS, whose further implementation will lead to a control board of delta land use and ecosystems status.
The evolution of coastline and bathymetric profiles in most sensible areas will be studied on a quantitative basis in relation with existing coastal defence structures and wave forcing.
The results should allow suggesting alternative management options of the coastal area.
Pesticides fluxes, from input on the delta drainage basin area, and salt fluxes at the sea interface, will be investigated, in order to estimate global transfer functions in the hydro system.
Empirical sociological study will be conducted, focusing on understanding actions, decision making processes, and their impact on the functioning of the water executive commission.
A role-playing game based on a Multi Agent simulation tool, will be used to assess negotiation processes while searching to establish sustainable management rules for coastal wetlands.

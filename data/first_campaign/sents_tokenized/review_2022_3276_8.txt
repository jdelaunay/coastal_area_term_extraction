The role of serpulid reefs in the ecosystems they inhabit is multifarious and may be distinguished in functions ( biomass and production , benthic pelagic coupling , resistance and resilience , reproductive and survivorship strategies , trophodynamics , bioconstruction , living space and refuge , nursery , sediment formation and retention , food for other species , carbonate deposition and storage ) and services ( water clearance , reef associated fishery , cultural benefits ) .

Survival and above - ground response variables to salinity were characterized in culture - experiments in which plants were exposed to increased salinity ( from 25 - 30 , 45 psu ) and decreased salinities ( from 25 - 25 , 20 , 15 , 10 , 6 , 4 , 2 , 0 . 9 , 0 . 52 and 0 psu ) treatments at two - week intervals .

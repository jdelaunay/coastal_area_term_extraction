This classification system targets on the following operational effect variables ( bioindicators ) , which are meant to reflect key structural and functional aspects of aquatic ecosystems and characteristic ( median ) values for entire defined areas ( the ecosystem scale ) for the growing season : Secchi depth ( as a standard measure of water clarity ) , chlorophyll - a concentrations ( a measure of primary phytoplankton bio mass ) , the oxygen saturation in the deep - water zone ( an indicator reflecting sedimentation , oxygen consumption , oxygen concentrations and the habitat conditions for zoobenthos , an important functional group ) and the macrophyte cover ( an important variable for the bioproduction potential , including fish production , and the " biological value " of aquatic systems ) .

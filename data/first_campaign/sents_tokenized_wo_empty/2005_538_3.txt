Two models exist for the profile evolution of shore platforms and associated cliffs : The first suggests that an equilibrium profile develops in response to erosive processes , and this profile subsequently migrates landward ; the second model suggests that the seaward margin of the shore platform is relatively static , and the profile extends landward through a combination of cliff recession and platform lowering .

The inversion of individual inherent optical properties ( IOPs ) is very challenging in optically complex waters and within the violet spectral range ( i . e . , 380 - 450 nm ) due to the strong light attenuation caused by chromophoric dissolved organic matter , nonalgal particulates , and phytoplankton .

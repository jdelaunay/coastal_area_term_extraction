Comprising six species , this group has a wide global distribution , with members occurring from shallow coastal areas to depths of c . 2500 m . The limited information available on their reproductive biology suggests that they could be vulnerable to overexploitation ( e . g . small litter sizes for most species and suspected long gestation periods ) .

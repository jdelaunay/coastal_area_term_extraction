Additionally , when physical mixing in water and / or sediments was slow or absent , anoxia resulted and enhanced the preservation of chloropigments - . a . Alternately , low productivity , low sedimentation rates , and the turnover of water and / or mixing of sediments resulted in the maintenance of oxic conditions , and increased degradation of chloropigments - . a and decomposition to colorless products .

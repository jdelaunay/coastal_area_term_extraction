The diatom assemblages of riverine conditions ( without salt - wedge influence ) were characterized by high abundances of the freshwater diatom species Cocconeis placentula , C . euglypta and Aulacoseira granulata , meanwhile high abundances of marine and marine - brackish species such as Paralia sulcata , Rhaphoneis amphiceros , Delphineis surirella and Diploneis interrupta were characteristic of estuarine conditions ( i . e . under salt - wedge influence ) .

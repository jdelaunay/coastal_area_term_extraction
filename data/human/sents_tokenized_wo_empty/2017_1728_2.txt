In the Apennine Chain , landscape evolution - in a ridge , valley and basin system - is connected to the regional uplift , local tectonic subsidence and local base level variations , which have led to changes in the drainage systems , from exoreic to endorheic ( in the intermontane basins ) and then to exoreic again .

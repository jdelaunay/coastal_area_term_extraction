For example , the cohesion between sediment particles could be increased by microorganisms through secreting extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS ) so as to enhance sediment stability ; salt - tolerant vegetation has an ability to improve the stability of the sediment bed by capacity of sediment retention and reducing hydrodynamic force ; the structure of sediment bed could be destroyed by coastal benthos through feeding and burrowing , which would lead to the failure of the bed .

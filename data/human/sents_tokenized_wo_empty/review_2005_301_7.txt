We conclude that climate change will likely ( i ) reduce the numbers of several target species of birds ; ( ii ) favour and stabilize cyanobacterial dominance in phytoplankton communities ; ( iii ) cause more serious incidents of botulism among waterfowl and enhance the spreading of mosquito borne diseases ; ( iv ) benefit invaders originating from the Ponto - Caspian region ; ( v ) stabilize turbid , phytoplankton - dominated systems , thus counteracting restoration measures ; ( vi ) destabilize macrophyte - dominated clear - water lakes ; ( vii ) increase the carrying capacity of primary producers , especially phytoplankton , thus mimicking eutrophication ; ( viii ) affect higher trophic levels as a result of enhanced primary production ; ( ix ) have a negative impact on biodiversity which is linked to the clear water state ; ( x ) affect biodiversity by changing the disturbance regime .

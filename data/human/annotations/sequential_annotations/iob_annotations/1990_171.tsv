A	O

made	O

the	O

These	O
included	O
three	O
species	B
of	O
Chydoridae	B
(	O
Alona	B

one	O
species	O

Macrothricidae	B
Iliocryptus	B

(	O

.	O
The	O
pattern	O
of	O
chydorid	B
abundance	I
was	O
similar	O
to	O
that	O
found	O
in	O
many	O
lakes	B
:	O
a	O
midsummer	O
peak	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
sharp	O
decrease	O
in	O
numbers	O
and	O
subsequent	O
low	O
abundance	B
.	O
This	O
was	O
caused	O
by	O
a	O
temporary	O
decrease	O
in	O
natality	B
,	O
possibly	O
due	O
to	O
food	B
limitation	I
,	O
and	O
a	O
more	O
permanent	O
increase	O
in	O
mortality	B
,	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
predation	B
.	O
Iliocryptus	B

differed	O
considerably	O
from	O
the	O
chydorids	B

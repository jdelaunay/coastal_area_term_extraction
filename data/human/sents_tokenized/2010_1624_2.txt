It has been found that : ( 1 ) sinkholes have formed within a strip 50 - 100 m wide along the salt formation edge ; ( 2 ) a zone with a large density of cavities with a total volume of tens of thousands of cubic meters have been inferred in sinkhole sites ; ( 3 ) cavities underlying sinkholes are filled with unconsolidated sediments locally reducing hydraulic conductivity .

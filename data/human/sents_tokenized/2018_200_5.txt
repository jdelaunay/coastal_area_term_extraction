The diurnal composite of the obtained parameters revealed key processes such as ( 1 ) just before the onset of the afternoon convective rain , the lower troposphere was moistened by subarray - scale processes ; ( 2 ) moistening of the troposphere continued during the convective heavy precipitation ; ( 3 ) the stratiform rains during the night were partly maintained by consuming the pre - existing hydrometeor aloft ; and ( 4 ) in the early morning , the clouds redeveloped over the ocean to produce precipitation as well as hydrometeor aloft .

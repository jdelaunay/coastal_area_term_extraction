The material is reworked and sorted by hydrodynamic forcing : the less mobile stones and boulders remain close to the source area ; the finest sediments , mostly clay and silt , are transported offshore into areas of low energy ; and the fractions of sand and fine gravels mostly remain in the nearshore zone , where they make up the littoral sediment budget .

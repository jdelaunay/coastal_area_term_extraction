The location of petroleum refineries strongly depends on the requirement of significant amounts of water for process , cooling and steam ; besides of that , mainly due to the need of guarantying efficient supply of raw materials and shipping of products , petroleum refineries are usually located in coastal areas , commonly constituted by sandy soils ; coastal sandy soils normally have low content of natural organic matter , but high soil water content ( SWC ) that has an important role on the distribution of the pollutants in the soil phases and , consequently , on the time and efficiency of remediation with SVE .

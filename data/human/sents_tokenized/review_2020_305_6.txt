Our results , merged with a review of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution in South China , emphasise the decisive role of the IndiaEurasia collision on the tectonics of South China in the Palaeogene and suggest the continuous northward drift of the Philippine Sea Plate and Australian Plate had a substantial effect on South China in the Neogene .

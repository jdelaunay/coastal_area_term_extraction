The remediation technology that is commonly applied to the remediation of soils contaminated with those pollutants is Soil Vapour Extraction ( SVE ) ; through the induction of vacuum to the soil matrix , SVE promotes the circulation of air within the soil , conducting the contaminant vapours removed to extraction wells and later to the atmosphere , after convenient treatment .

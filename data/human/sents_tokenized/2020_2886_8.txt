Evaluating global chemical model simulations at sub - regional scales will help air quality scientists understand the complex processes occurring at small spatial and temporal scales within complex surface terrain changes , simulating nighttime chemistry and deposition , and the potential to use global chemical transport simulations in support of regional and sub - regional field campaigns .

Understanding the roles of biological effects in coastal sediment dynamics and evolution of coastal geomorphology is helpful for enriching theory of coastal sediment dynamics , promoting the intersection of coastal dynamics , sediment dynamics and ecological environmentology , and promoting the development of the research field " biomorphodynamics " .

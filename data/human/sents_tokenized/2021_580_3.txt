To this end , we sampled benthic macroinvertebrate communities and measured environmental variables ( water temperature , dissolved oxygen , conductivity , pH , nitrate , turbidity , blue - green algal phycocyanin , chlorophyll - a ) as well as structural parameters ( habitat type , lake size , maximum depth ) in 28 lakes within Hohe Tauern National Park , Austria , between altitudes of 2 , 000 and 2 , 700 m a . s . l .

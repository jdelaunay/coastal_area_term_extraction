The results demonstrate that : the main chemistry types of underground brine is Na - Cl and Na - Mg - Cl , and its hydrochemical characteristics consist well with seawater ; the coefficients namely rNa / rCl , k / br , rMg / rCa , indicate the underground brines , with greater concentration and weaker metamorphism , originated from seawater .

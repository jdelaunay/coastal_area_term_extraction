Compared to surface observations , we find the GEOS - CF product with a 25 25 km2 grid box , at an hourly ( R2 : 0 . 62 to 0 . 87 ) and 15 - min ( R2 : 0 . 64 to 0 . 87 ) interval for six regional sites outperforms the hourly nominally 50 50 km2 gridded MERRA2 - GMI ( R2 : 0 . 53 to 0 . 76 ) for four of the six sites , suggesting it is better capable of simulating complex chemical and meteorological features associated with ozone transport within the Chesapeake Bay airshed .

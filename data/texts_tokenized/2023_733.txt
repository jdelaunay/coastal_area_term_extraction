In order to detect the effects of different stressors on the littoral diatom assemblages and biodiversity of the lentic systems in two different basins in Trkiye, 15 lentic systems in the Akaray and Asi basins were sampled three times (spring, summer, and fall) for littoral diatoms and environmental variables.
The biological assessment of these sites was also evaluated using 9 different river and lake diatom indices.
Based on the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), salinity (SAL) values, and dominant diatom species, three lentic systems in Akaray Basin (Lake Eber, 26 Austos Pond, and Lake Karamk) were more eutrophic and under the pressure of anthropogenic and climatic (precipitation) stressors.
Trophic diatom index for lakes (TDIL) showed a higher correlation with TN and TP and was the most effective index in explaining ecological quality in 15 lentic systems.
The species richness of diatoms was also negatively affected by EC and SAL values.
The lentic systems of the two basins were separated from each other based on the species composition and the distribution of the dominant species with the effect of altitude (ALT).
Considering the distribution of diatom assemblage of the lentic systems in these two basins, anthropogenic, climatic, and geographical factors have become prominent to shape the diatom community structure.

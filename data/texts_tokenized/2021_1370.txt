2021 The Author(s)Soil salinity in the coastal areas of Bangladesh has been rising.
The responses of forest communities to the rise of salinity are somehow documented.
However, the adjustments of non-forest plant communities against salinity are still limited in the literature.
This study explains the phytosociology and the herbaceous plant biodiversity along with the soil salinity gradients in Shyamnagar, Bangladesh.
Twenty-five roadside quadrants were systematically selected and studied for herbaceous plant diversity and soil properties.
Soil Electrical conductivity (EC) and moisture show a generally rising trend from the north to the south.
Moreover, the quadrants closer to the river or aquaculture with low elevation represent the salinity hot spots.
About 1116 herbaceous plants belonging to 11 species were recorded.
Croton bonplandianum baill is the dominant species and showed higher adaption capacity against soil EC values.
Four out of 25 quadrants with higher EC, moisture and lower elevation recorded no plants.
The herbaceous plant biodiversity reveals a strong spatial pattern and tendency to shrink with the rise of soil salinity while progressing towards the southeast direction.
The area shows aggregated population, contagious distribution of plant species, and accommodates four dominant clusters.
Roadside herbs not only hold medicinal value but also offer important cooking fuel choices to the fuel-scarce coastal communities.
The outcome of this study provides important insights into herbaceous plant diversity and its relationships with soil salinity.
Overall, the study outcomes improve our understanding of the impact of environmental stressors on the distribution of herbaceous plants in the coastal area.

Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.Erosion is responsible for environmental degradation in continental and coastal areas, with varying degrees of intensity and spatial range.
In continental areas, rills and gullies affect both urban and non-urban areas, and they may occur in isolation or in groups.
To illustrate such cases in Brazil, this study examines the adoption of different techniques to recovery gullies in the cities of Sao Pedro, Franca and Sao Carlos, in the state of Sao Paulo.
All of these areas are constituted by sandy geological materials in a variety of landscapes, and the erosionprocesses arise from natural and anthropogenic conditions.
There are positive results in someof the areas studied, but unsatisfactory results predominate, mainly because there were no appropriate geological, environmental and geotechnical studies performed before selecting and implementing the interventions.

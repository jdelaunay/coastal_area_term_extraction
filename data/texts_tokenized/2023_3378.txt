To solve the problems of large connecting force and complexity of large-span structure connecting high-rise buildings in coastal areas under wind and earthquake loads, a hybrid isolation technology based on the friction pendulum bearing and switchable fluid damper was proposed.
The damping force characteristic of switchable fluid damper, combining viscous damper and hydraulic valve, was experimentally studied.
And a multi-performance objective design method for large-span structure connecting high-rise buildings was proposed in this paper.
The results demonstrate that the isolation frequency of the large-span structure should be taken as the optimal frequency of the tuned vibration system to minimize the displacement of high-rise buildings.
The switchable damper achieves velocity-dependent damping force and displacement-dependent damping force.
Compared with the friction force of the friction pendulum bearing, the displacement-dependent damping force of switchable fluid damper is not affected by the wind load, and the control effect on sliding displacement is better.
The velocity-dependent damping force is employed to achieve the seismic performance in cooperation with the friction force of the friction pendulum bearing.

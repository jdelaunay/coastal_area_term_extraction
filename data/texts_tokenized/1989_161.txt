Discusses aspects of longshore sediment transport which affect marina design.
The pattern of longshore currents may be: 1, cell circulation (incident waves parallel to the beach line), with rip currents possible, 2) general circulation (slight angle to the incident waves) or 3) steady longshore current (oblique wave approach).
Outlines the main types of numerical and physical models for prediction of sediment transport problems.

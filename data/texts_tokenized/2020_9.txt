The occurrence of erosion in coastal areas is caused by a combination of factors nature and human action.
Therefore, a study was conducted at Regency Beach, Port Dickson to find out the shoreline changes in the area.
Eight remote sensing data from 1988 to 2019 were used in this study using ArcGIS 10.3 and DSAS v4.2 software to obtain shoreline changes.
It can be concluded that the pattern of shoreline changed from 1988 to 2019 in the study area and much erosion occurred between 2005 and 2010.

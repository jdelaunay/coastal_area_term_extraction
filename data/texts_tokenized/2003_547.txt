We studied fatty acid (FA) composition in samples from bodies and intestinal contents of the littoral amphipod Gammarus lacustris Sars, from the Bugach freshwater reservoir.
Simultaneously, samples of seston and bottom sediments were also collected from the reservoir during early August.
There were no differences in FA composition of gut contents, seston and sediments of pebbly bottom.
Seston was the main food source of Gammarus but some FAs Gammarus got from sediments.
The FA composition of G. lacustris and seston from the Bugach freshwater reservoir were compared with those of the animals from the saltwater Lake Shira (Siberia).
While FA composition of the two Gammarus populations differed significantly, those of seston were practically similar: the composition of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, 20:53, 22:63 and 20:46, were significantly higher in animals from saline Shira Lake, whereas 16:1 and 16:0 were higher in the freshwater populations of amphipods from the Bugach freshwater reservoir.
Taking into account the relevant literature data, we hypothesise that this difference in C16 acid might be a distinguishing characteristic of FA composition of freshwater and saltwater crustaceans.

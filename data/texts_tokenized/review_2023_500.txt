Microplastics (MPs), which are small plastic particles measuring less than 5 mm in size, have emerged as a significant environmental concern in marine ecosystems worldwide.
The presence of MPs in aquatic environments has increased due to the contributions from anthropogenic and terrestrial sources, raising concerns about their abundance in aquatic organisms.
MPs primarily originate from the photo-degradation of larger plastic debris (macroplastics), with their release into the environment often occurring through the breakdown of additive compounds.
The ingestion of MPs poses eco-toxicological risks to marine organisms, causing damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and stomachs of affected organisms.
Approximately 80 % of MPs originate from terrestrial sources, which can be classified as either primary sources, such as those generated during the production of skincare products, tires, and the use of MPs as carriers for pharmaceutical products, or secondary sources resulting from the improper disposal of plastics near coastal areas and water bodies.
The issue of MPs and their potential effects on the marine ecosystem demands significant attention.
In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability of microplastics in marine environments, consolidating the current understanding of their sources, distribution, fate, and ecological impacts.
It emphasizes the urgent need for ongoing research and proactive measures to mitigate the potential long-term consequences of microplastic pollution on marine ecosystems and the essential services they provide.

Microplastics (MPs) emerge as new contaminants in the marine environment, endangering both the ecosystem and humans.
Plastic weathering increases the bioavailability of MPs to marine organisms.
Thus, this paper reviewed the occurrence of plastics in the Middle East marine environment and their impact on the organism.
The availability of waste and plastic waste generation data varies by country in the Middle East.
Turkiye provides numerous reports on MPs in the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt conducted extensive research in the Red Sea, whereas the Gulf nations performed comprehensive studies on MPs.
MPs in the Mediterranean Sea (2.60 105 MPs/km2) and Arabian Gulf (up to 4.6 104 particles/km2) were considered higher than other waters in the Middle East.
Waste Water Treatment Plants are the major source of MPs in the coastal area.
The research on MPs in marine organisms was carried out systematically in the Trkey and Arabian Gulf.
There is sufficient data to assess the vulnerability of MPs to human daily consumption; however, data in the Red Sea is sparse.
Furthermore, each country developed its own strategies to combat plastic waste.
As a result, coordinated measures to combat plastic pollution, particularly in the Middle East marine environment, might be recommended.
Profound research on the MPs entry pathway into the unique character of the Middle East marine environment, as well as their fate and behavior, can be proposed.

Food habits of young-of-the-year walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum) were determined in Okobojo Bay of Lake Oahe, South Dakota from June through September, 1991.
Walleyes initially fed on zooplankton but soon became piscivorous.
Smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus) were initially the most important prey fish, but rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) became important as walleyes moved from the littoral zone of the bay to open water.
The only macroinvertebrates found in walleye stomachs were ephemerids and chironomids; their incidence was low.

Here, we assess ingestion of synthetic micro-fibres (i.e. microplastics and other non-natural fibres, 0.5-5 mm in size) by Mute Swans Cygnus olor inhabiting a large freshwater reservoir (n = 12 faecal samples), and from Whooper Swans C. cygnus wintering on a remote offshore Atlantic island (n = 11 faecal samples).
Samples were chemically digested to eliminate labile organic matter including natural fibres.
In total, 79 synthetic micro-fibres were recovered at frequencies of 4.2 0.8 and 2.6 0.7 (mean s.e.)
per sample, ranging from 0-10 and 0-7 micro-fibres per sample, for Mute Swan and Whooper Swan faecal samples, respectively.
The number of synthetic micro-fibres recovered did not differ significantly between species or sites.
Similarly, there was no difference in the number of synthetic micro-fibres detected per gram of faecal sample.
Overall, our preliminary data further bolster emerging records for the ingestion of synthetic debris by non-marine waterbirds inhabiting freshwater and coastal areas.

All Rights Reserved.Features of the physiographic and economic and geographical position of the Azov-Black Sea coast determined the regional development vector.
On the one hand, the Azov-Black Sea coast is one of the main resort regions of the Russian Federation, which received 25.1 million people in 2018, most of whom are aimed at beach and sea tourism.
On the other hand, sea ports, as a part of the system of international transport corridors, provided processing of 272,156.34 thousand tons of cargo.
At the moment, the port infrastructure of the Azov-Black Sea basin of the Russian Federation is represented by 9 active seaports of Krasnodar Region, 3 ports of Rostov Region, as well as 4 ports of the Republic of Crimea and a port of federal importance in Sevastopol (http://www.morflot.ru).
Based on the logic of the existence of seaports, as commercial enterprises operating for profit, development and introduction of new technologies, automation and optimization of logistics, loading and unloading and other economic activities ensuring the growth of cargo handling volumes, the fact that direct interest in territorial expansion and urbanization of adjacent areas in order to increase the intensity of traffic becomes obvious.
The simultaneous presence in the coastal zone of two main economic drivers of the region, tourism and recreational and industrial activity leads to the increased conflict of interests of economic, social and environmental spheres of activity.
The threats and factors that adversely affect the sustainable development of coastal areas are identified.
Possible directions of interaction are proposed on the basis of the mutually beneficial development of enterprises of the tourism and recreation complex and maritime transport.

Construction of a trial offshore breakwater at Semaphore Park in Adelaide, South Australia was completed in February 2005.
The breakwater was designed to protect part of the eroding coast and also to trap littoral drift sand for recycling to other eroding areas.
It was constructed using sand filled geotextile tubes (geotubes) so that removal would be comparatively straightforward if the trial proved unsuccessful.
Preliminary analysis of satellite images and engineering survey indicates that the trial breakwater is modifying coastal processes as expected.
However, the structural integrity of the geotube breakwater has deteriorated rapidly, demonstrating that the effective life of this type of structure is in the order of two to three years under metropolitan Adelaide's coastal conditions.

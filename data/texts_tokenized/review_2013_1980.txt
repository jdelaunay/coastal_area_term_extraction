Brown trout, Salmo trutta, is a polymorphic species that exhibits different migratory behaviors in different streams.
Some populations contain juveniles that eventually migrate to the sea.
In others, downstream movements are infrequent and individuals tend to spend their whole lives in freshwater.
The term "partial migration" is used to describe the phenomenon by which a population is divided into resident and anadromous individuals.
In rivers located in coastal areas with access to the sea, anadromous trout and resident trout usually live together and anadromous individuals return to home rivers to spawn.
Adult migrants and residents can mate successfully and parr can grow together, indistinguishable until the time of smoltification.
Migrants reach maturity after a period of growth in the sea, while the residents mature in fresh water, often at a smaller size.
The decision between anadromy and residency in fresh water is an example of phenotypic plasticity and it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with migration occurring when a threshold of genetic and environmental conditions is exceeded.
This chapter reviews the most relevant publications on the early life stages of the brown trout, including studies and experiments in genetics, ecology and zoology.
We pay special attention to all the freshwater phases of the trout life cycle (since the eggs are fertilized in the nest, until the anadromous parr migrate to the sea) in order to investigate those genetic and environmental factors related with sea migration.

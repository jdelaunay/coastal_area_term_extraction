The future more sustainable management of coastal resources is an important policy goal for all governments of countries with coastlines.
Coastal areas are under intense environmental change pressure with extensive feedback effects between the natural systems and the human systems.
It could be argued that there is just one jointly determined and coevolving system that needs to be studied and managed.
Understanding the interactions between the coastal zone and environmental change cannot be achieved by observational studies alone.
Modelling of key environmental and socio-economic processes is a vital tool, required to buttress coastal management institutions and practice.
Three overlapping procedural stages can be identified in the coastal resource assessment process.
The scoping and auditing stage, implemented via a 'pressure-state-impact-response' framework, details, among other thing, problems, system boundaries and value conflicts.
The framework is itself based on a conceptual model, which lays stress on functional value diversity and the links between ecosystem processes, functions and outputs of goods and services which are deemed 'valuable' by society.
The two subsequent stages are integrated modelling, combining natural and social science methodologies, and evaluation of management options and related gains and losses.
An overview of a research project, which utilised the pressure-state-impacts-response (P-S-I-R) framework and supporting concepts and methods, is presented in the last section of the paper, together with some generic 'lessons' for interdisciplinary research.

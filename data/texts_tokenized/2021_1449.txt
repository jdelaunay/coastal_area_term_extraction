For this, larvae and juveniles were sampled in both systems.
The temporal and spatial patterns of the ichthyoplankton community were described for each system and related to the influence of environmental factors.
Additionally, the recruitment pattern was evaluated based on the composition of juveniles.
Results show a seasonal variation of larval density and community structure between and within systems, indicating a degree of segregation according to their ecological functional classification.
Temperature was the most important environmental factor structuring the communities.
The juvenile recruitment patterns observed show a different nursery function of the estuary and coastal area for early life stages of different species, reinforcing the need to integrate larval and juvenile stages to better understand fish life cycles and the connectivity between systems.

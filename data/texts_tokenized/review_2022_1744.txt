Pollutants migrate, accumulate, and diffuse in aquatic environments.
Most of the pollutants eventually enter aquatic organisms.
The accumulation of pollutants affects the development and reproduction of organisms, and many pollutants have teratogenic, carcinogenic, and/or mutagenic effects.
Aquatic organisms in estuaries and coastal areas are under pressure due to both salinity and pollutants.
Among them, salinity, as an environmental factor, may affect the behavior of pollutants in the aquatic environment, causing changes in their toxic effects on fishes.
Salinity also directly affects the growth and development of fishes.
Therefore, this paper focuses on metals and organic pollutants and discusses the toxic effects of pollutants on fish under different salinities.
This research is of great significance to environmental protection and ecological risk assessment of aquatic environments.

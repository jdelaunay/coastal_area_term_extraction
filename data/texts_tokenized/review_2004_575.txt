In an era of increasing concern for limited water resources a wise joint management of conventional and non-conventional water resources must be considered.
Water scarcity aggravates in coastal zones which are often characterised by high population density, intense economic activity and tourism; meaning heavy seasonal water demands.
The relationships between sea and land-water can also compromise the quality of available freshwater.
In this context, the use of non-conventional water increases the availability of water supplies.
Non-conventional water resources of low quality could be directed to meet several needs (like watering lawns, washing cars, flushing toilets and cooling systems, among others).
Therefore, significantly more potable water would be available to meet human demand for safe water.

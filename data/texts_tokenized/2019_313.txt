2019, The Author(s).In order to give an in-depth understanding of the contradictions arising from the land resource supply and demand, this study selected 30 provinces (some are autonomous regions or municipalities) in China to be the research unit, used the carbon emission as an undesirable output, and adopted the Super-SBM DEA model and ESDA-GWR method to research the evolution characteristics and influencing factors of land use efficiency in China in 20032013.
The results indicated that: (1) The land use efficiency in China overall was moderately ineffective and the overall utilization level was low; (2) The Global Spatial Autocorrelation was instable and had maintained a high level; (3) The hot spots mainly being distributed in the southeast coastal regions and cold spots being found in the central and western regions, so that as time goes on, the pattern of high in the east and low in the west has been gradually formed and stabilized.
(4) The GWR model analysis showed that the natural factors such as NDVI, DMSP/OLS and DEM have a significant impact on land use efficiency, thereby providing an important contribution to this study.
For the eastern coastal areas, the emphasis should be improving their OT, PF and PGDP, for the western region, should focus on improving its comprehensive economic development level to improve the DMSP/OLS, while strengthening the ecological environment to improve the level of NDVI.

Following an outline of factors determining shore ecology, eight types of shore are described and an outline is given of the littoral biotopes defined in the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) classification.
Biotope matrices show the distribution of biotopes within the primary habitat features of zonation and wave exposure, or zonation and sediment type.
There follows the bulk of the report: biotope descriptions, including indicator taxa, distribution maps and colour illustrations.
Some practical considerations are given, and six appendices cover the index and correlations; terms used for field recording and habitat definition; taxonomic guides; MNCR abundance scales for field recording; biotope matrices; and comparative tables of species in each biotope.

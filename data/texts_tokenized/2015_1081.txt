All rights reserved.Coral spawning slicks were noticed for the first time near Kudankulam coastal area, Southern Gulf of Mannar, Tamil Nadu.
Timing of coral spawning in Gulf of Mannar has been reported to be March every year.
Thus this record aligns with the previous record from Tuticorin coastal region and a recent report from Lakshadweep Islands.
Linking the sighting of numerous coral recruits and the current sighting of spawning slicks in this area it is believed that corals in Kudankulam coastal area, though in patches are sexually mature and actively participate in sexual reproduction.

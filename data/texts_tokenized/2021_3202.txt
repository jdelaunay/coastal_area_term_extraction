Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Coastal flooding is a natural disaster that often occurs in coastal areas.
Jakarta is an exam-ple of a location that is highly vulnerable to coastal flooding.
Coastal flooding can result in economic and human life losses.
Thus, there is a need for a coastal flooding early warning system in vulnerable locations to reduce the threat to the community and strengthen its resilience to coastal flooding disasters.
This study aimed to measure the level of public acceptance toward the development of a coastal flooding early warning system of people who live in a coastal region in Jakarta.
This knowledge is essential to ensure that the early warning system can be implemented successfully.
A survey was conducted by distributing questionnaires to people in the coastal areas of Jakarta.
The questionnaire results were analyzed using cross-tabulation and path analysis based on the variables of knowledge, perceptions, and community attitudes towards the development of a coastal flooding early warning system.
The survey result shows that the level of public acceptance is excellent, as proven by the average score of the respondents attitude by 4.15 in agreeing with the establishment of an early warning system to manage coastal flooding.
Thus, path analysis shows that knowledge and perception have a weak relationship with community attitudes when responding to the coastal flooding early warning model.
The results show that only 23% of the communitys responses toward the coastal flooding early warning model can be explained by the communitys knowledge and perceptions.
This research is expected to be useful in implementing a coastal flooding early warning system by considering the level of public acceptance.

All Rights Reserved.Mangroves are a crucial ecosystem in coastal areas and serve a significant ecological function.
However, this ecosystem is under the continuous pressure of anthropogenic activities which create toxic contaminants, such as heavy metals.
The presence of marine ports and electric steam power plants next to Bee Jay Bakau Resort (BJBR) Mangrove Forest may worsen the heavy metal pollution, especially in the case of non-essential metals like lead (Pb).
The vegetation in mangrove ecosystems can help store and trap this contaminant.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the potency of the Avicennia alba and Rhizopora mucronata mangrove species, which dominate the mangrove vegetation in BJBR Mangrove Forest, as Pb phytoremediation agents.
The samples were taken from the sediment, roots, stems, and leaves of the mangrove trees.
The results showed that the Pb found in the sediment of these species ranged from 10.323 to 11.071 ppm, while the Pb concentration in the mangrove parts was less than 1 ppm with the order roots > stems > leaves.
Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the Pb values across sites and species.
Moreover, the BCF, BAC, and TF in this study were less than 1, making the observed mangrove species unsuitable for phytoextraction or phytostabilization.

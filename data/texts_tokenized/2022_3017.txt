Frequent dredging is required to ensure drainage performance, posing a significant economic burden on agricultural producers.
This research aims to discover the possibility of using vegetative filter strips to reduce the ditch sedimentation rate and evaluate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR's ditch sedimentation monitoring ability in the densely vegetated drainage ditch condition.
These sites were established in the coastal area of Lake Sainte Pierre near St. Cuthbert, Yamachiche and Baie-du-Febvre.
Starting from Nov. 2019, three ditches in all three sites are treated with 0, 2-m, and 4-m vegetative filter strips.
Four rounds of cross-section measurements were conducted at a 20-m interval of all ditches using an electronic total station in 2019-2021 to calculate sediment accumulation in drainage ditches.
In addition to the total station survey, the ditches were scanned using a LiDAR-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) once per year for comparison with the acquired total station data.
The results generally suggest no significant difference in sediment deposition during the monitoring period.
However, the result showed a reverse effect where most drainage ditches experienced a volume increase across the experiment, indicating soil erosion, not sedimentation, might happen in the Lac Sainte-Pierre's drainage ditch.
Also, a decimeter level of difference has been found between the LiDAR data and the total station data showing the limited capability of UAV-LiDAR in agricultural drainage ditch sedimentation monitoring.

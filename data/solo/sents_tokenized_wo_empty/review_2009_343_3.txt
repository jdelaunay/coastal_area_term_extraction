In this review article, the authors (1) describe in detail the mechanism of OSA formation and controlling parameters which can influence OSA formation (the parameters discussed include the oil nature and properties, sediment types and concentrations, and the environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and mixing energy); (2) briefly review qualitative and quantitative methods used for characterization of OSA formation (two main methods used for the OSA characterization are the UV epi-fluorescence microscopy and gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector (GC-FID); (3) elucidate the applications of OSA formation in oil spill response strategies including natural attenuation, sediment relocation, and sediment mixing; and (4) discuss research needs in the future which would further improve our understanding of OSA formation and move towards the development of adequate oil behaviour models.

Abstract: The spatial and seasonal distribution of heterotrophic bacterioplankton has been studied in Lake Pleshcheyevo.
Over the past 30 years, the abundance of microorganisms has increased threefold.
The maximum values have been recorded at littoral stations.
The main part of bacterial production is also produced there.
Trophic levels have increased, but the ecosystem of the lake withstands the increased load.

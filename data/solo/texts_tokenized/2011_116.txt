Coastal caves in southern Mallorca have abundant underwater continuations.
Recent exploration and survey of those caves and submerged galleries highlights the genetic relationship between hydrology and karst.
Most of the coastal caves result from the sea caves enlargement by wave erosion and the capture of neighbour karstic caves; additionally coastal freshwater springs result from the interference hydrological gradients between kartic cavities and the sea.
Those littoral cavities represent the sea inland influence extension and are a key element of the Mallorca natural heritage.

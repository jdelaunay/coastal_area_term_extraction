The nutrients such as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, NH4+-N, NO2-N, and NO3-N), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP, PO43) and dissolved SiO2 (DSi) funneled by the inlet river are the dominant factors to coastal eutrophication.
This study investigated nutrient transport process in typical inlet rivers in the Yellow River Delta.
The indicator of coastal eutrophication potential and concentration ratio between upstream and downstream stations were used to evaluate the influence of different sources to the nutrient risks.
It showed that urban areas are the most important source of the nutrients in studied rivers.
The harbor and mariculture would have greater risk because of their proximity close to the coastal area.
Wetland was a vital conversion to eliminate the river nutrients, and the retention could reach 80 %.
It is imperative to protect and construct wetlands to reduce the nutrient pollution in the inlet river.

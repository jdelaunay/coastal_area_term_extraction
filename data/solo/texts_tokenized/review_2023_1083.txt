Mangrove forests, which are well known for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are a very productive ecosystem found in estuarine and coastal areas in tropical and subtropical latitudes.
This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka.
In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations.
Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests.
Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards.
Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country.
Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka.
Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions.
In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented.
Proper planting of seedlings, community-based mangrove reforestation, sustainable aquaculture practices and proper legal enforcement are some of the important steps for the conservation of this highly productive ecosystem in the country.

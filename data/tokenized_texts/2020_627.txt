2020 LtdMarine ecosystems provide goods and services for human well-being, and many of them correspond to cultural ecosystem services (CES).
In Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), recreational activities such as snorkeling have increased recently, taking advantage of CES.
However, there is a lack of educational initiatives in temperate areas to promote seascape enjoyment and pro-environmental behavior among these users, in contrast with other coastal areas such as subtropical and Caribbean ones.
In this study, we have designed and implemented several snorkeling trails in Ces Archipelago to address a better usage of CES, in a National Park (NP) context.
To assess the seascape in Ces from the point of view of the marine and sea-watching activities that take place in the NP, a new methodology was designed and implemented, including a pilot experience with snorkelers.
This methodology assesses underwater aesthetic values from a multifaceted approach and allows the identification of trail-specific features that should be highlighted for increasing conservation awareness among users through environmental education and interpretation.
Also, include the analysis of the users perception and experience satisfaction, as the factors that may be influencing their pro-environmental behaviors and knowledge.
Our results show that snorkeling is a good activity to learn about the seascape values, and the NP could offer it as a guided activity considering some pre and post snorkeling experience requirements.

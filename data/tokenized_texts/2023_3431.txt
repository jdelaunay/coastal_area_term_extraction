Abstract: Microorganisms of unique preservation have been found in the Byuk formation of the Vendian (Ediacaran) of the Berezovsky trough in the southeast of the Siberian platform.
These microorganisms are present in silicified columnar stromatolites; i.e. they inhabited the littoral and sublittoral zones.
The microorganisms are characterized by the lamellar body type, the presence of rods fusing the plates with each other, and the presence of a pedunculated reproductive organ.
Based on these characteristics typical of Ulvaceae, the microorganisms are described as representatives of green algae (Chlorophyta) that belong to the order Ulvales Blackman et Tansley and presumably correspond to the family Anchicodiaceae Shuysky, 1987.
A new genus, Palaeoulvaria, with the type species P. plate gen.
et sp. nov. has been identified.

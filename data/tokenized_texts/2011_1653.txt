In this study, the daily rainfall data of Global Summary Of The Day (GSOD) from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) were used with careful consideration of data availability.
The daily rainfall data from August 1985 to January 2010 were analyzed at 10 observation points.
The results showed that significant differences of rainfall characteristics exist and they are classified into three regions as follows: Sumatra: multi-annual rain seasons for five long are dominant.
Sever dry one or two years appeared in between the multi-annual rain seasons (1990-1992, 1999).
Java Sea coastal area: clear variation in the annual rain and dry seasons.
East Indonesia: multi-annual rain seasons same as Sumatra with clear annual fluctuation of wet and dry seasons.
These rainfall characteristics are discussed with the correlation of oceanic climate change indicators (DMI: Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index, MEI: Pacific Ocean oscillation, PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation).
Daily precipitation has high correlation with these indices in particular with MEI or PDO.
Dry year appears in El Nino phase (PDO warm phase) and rainy year is the opposite.
Dateline El Nino (CP El Nino) that warm seawater stays at the position of the International Date Line, is prone to extreme weather such as heavy rain.
In fact, a significant rainfall occurs during the transition of MEI and PDO.
The changes in average global temperature (IPCC), NAO (North Pacific Ocean oscillation index) and the PDO have the long-term variations of about 30-40 years.
Apparently temperature and these indices have clear changes in 1903, 1944, and 1977.
PDO seems to be shifting to cool phase (La Nina dominant phase) after 2005 and rainfall in Indonesia is also on the increase.

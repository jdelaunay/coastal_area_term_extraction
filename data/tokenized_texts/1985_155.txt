SUMMARY.
A study of the distribution, biomass and production of the freshwater mussel Hyridella menziesi (Gray) was carried out at six sites in Tapuaeharuru Bay, Lake Taupo, New Zealand.
H. menziesi is common in the littoral zone, with clean sand and angle of slope being the most important environmental variables measured which are positively associated with mussel density.
These variables are related to the accumulation of fine material which can clog the filtering mechanism of mussels.
The angle of slope may also influence the movement and supply of food.
Density (5.6 m2), biomass (2.8 g dry weight shell free tissue m2) and potential production (0.50 g dry weight shell free tissue m2 yr1) are high compared to values found for mussels from other oligotrophic lakes.
The age structure of Hyridella suggests recruitment has declined in recent years.
A periodicity in generations is proposed.

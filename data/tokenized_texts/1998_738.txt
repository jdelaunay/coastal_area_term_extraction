Several loriciferans representing different developmental stages were recovered during a meiobenthic survey of the coarse, organogenic, sand of the Meloria shoals, Livorno, Italy.
Loriciferans were found in low numbers and only in few of the monthly samples collected over a 15-month period.
Adults and postlarvae were always found in the upper 15 cm of the sediment, while the presence of larvae was noted down to 3035 cm.
A taxonomic analysis revealed that all specimens belong to an undescribed species of the genus Nanaloricus.
Diagnosis and description of Nanaloricus khaitatus n. sp. is given based on the adult, postlar-val, and larval stages.
This is the first report ever of loriciferans from Italian waters, and the first record of the genus Nanaloricus in the Mediterranean Sea.
The presence of these rare animals is indicative of the high naturalistic value of this coastal area of Tuscany.

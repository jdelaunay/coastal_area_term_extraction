2021, The Author(s).Soil salinity is a major issue causing land degradation in coastal areas.
In this study, we assessed the land use and soil salinity changes in Djilor district (Senegal) using remote sensing and field data.
We performed land use land cover changes for the years 1984, 1994, 2007, and 2017.
Electrical conductivity was measured from 300 soil samples collected at the study area; this, together with elevation, distance to river, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Salinity Index (SI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), was used to build the salinity model using a multiple regression analysis.
Supervised classification and intensity analysis were applied to determine the annual change area and the variation of gains and losses.
The results showed that croplands recorded the highest gain (17%) throughout the period 19842017, while forest recorded 3%.
The fastest annual area of change occurred during the period 19841994.
The salinity model showed a high potential for mapping saline areas (R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.68).
Regarding salinity change, the slightly saline areas (2 < EC < 4 dS/m) increased by 42% whereas highly saline (EC > 8 dS/m) and moderately saline (4 < EC < 8 dS/m) areas decreased by 23% and 26%, respectively, in 2017.
Additionally, the increasing salt content is less dominant in vegetated areas compared with non-vegetated areas.
Nonetheless, the highly concentrated salty areas can be restored using salt-resistant plants (e.g., Eucalyptus sp., Tamarix sp.).
This study gives more insights on land use planning and salinity management for improving farmers resilience in coastal regions.

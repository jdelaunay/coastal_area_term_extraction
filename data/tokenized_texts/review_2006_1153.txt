In the Andes, the study of the Pleistocene state of the instantaneous deformation shows, along the active margin, different types of behaviour of the South American continental plate.
In Ecuador, the coastal block is pushed northwards.
The coastal area is affected by a N-S trending extension, as result of the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge and the uplift of the coast.
On the other hand, the main range is affected by an E-W shortening deformation.
The Bolivian High Andes show a N-S Pleistocene tensional deformation, due to body forces.
In central and south Chile, the Pleistocene deformation was partitioned into two states of stress: in the forearc zone the state of stress was compressional and striking N-S, in the intra-arc zone the state of stress was transpressional and NE trending.

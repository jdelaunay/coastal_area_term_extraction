Coastlines are physically dynamic environments that are continually being shaped and reshaped by tides, waves, erosion, storms, flooding, and climate change.
They are also the most densely populated places in the United States.
Coastal tourism and waterborne industries, like commercial finishing and energy production, are obviously dependent upon a healthy and well-functioning natural environment.
Planners in coastal areas are presented with a wide range of challenges in their efforts to balance protection of these sensitive natural environments with the intense and increasing impacts of human and economic-activity.

All rights reserved.Tropical cyclones (TCs) are a common natural hazard that have significantly impacted Oman.
Over the period 1881-2014, 41 TC systems made landfall in Oman, each associated with extreme winds, storm surges and major flash floods, often resulting in loss of life and substantial damage to infrastructure.
TCs affect Omani coastal areas from Muscat in the north to Salalah in the south, but developing a better understanding of high-risk areas is needed, and is a particular interest of disaster risk reduction institutions in Oman.
The focus of this study is therefore to better understand likely TC tracks and the spatiotemporal distribution of TC landfall in Oman to identify high-risk areas.
The analysis of tracks uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Linear Direction Mean (LDM) methods to better identify the spatio-temporal distribution of TC landfall in Oman.

Monitoring of hazardous substances in the Romanian marine environment is required in order to improve knowledge of the health state of nature and the threats, if there are any, against human population, and also in order to enable Romania to fulfill its international obligations to the Black Sea Convention and under EC Directives.
This paper aims to review currently available data for the Romanian marine environment on heavy metals in biota and identify any gaps in information that may require further monitoring or method development.
The results of the assessments conducted in the last 10 years regarding heavy metals (copper, cadmium, lead, nickel and chromium) bioaccumulation levels in some representative marine species from the Romanian littoral are presented.
Metals were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry method (GF-AAS).
The results offered the opportunity to study heavy metals bioaccumulation mechanisms, which represent a major component in the process of assessment of the pollution effects upon marine ecosystem health.
Investigations of metals bioaccumulation levels evinced not only important interspecific differences, due to trophic and cologie peculiarities of each species, but also intraspecific variations caused by physiological state or geographical location.

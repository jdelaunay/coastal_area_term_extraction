ACRS 2021.All right reserved.Climate change, in conjunction with land conversion, has a major effect on the world's coastline region.
Low-lying coastal communities and villages have already suffered devastation from catastrophic floods and must now contend with increasing seas.
The world's 11 fastest sinking cities have been identified (CNN, 2018).
The source of flooding, impact, mitigation, and adaption strategies within the coastal area are vary across those rural areas.
As a result, it is important to examine the influence of the two primary causes of coastal flooding, there is land use change and climate change.
The purpose of this article is to assess land use cover change (LUCC), climate change's influence, and the sinking coast's impact due to those phenomenon.
The method includes combining multiple-date remote sensing data analysis and spatial analysis, either through change detection of land and water and the accuracy assessment analysis.
The findings, deductively, show a link between LUCC, climate change, coastal flooding, and indicate the role of water change detection (WCD), LUCC detection (LUCCD) and Built-up area change detection (BCD) for rapidly mapping the coastal flooding for mitigate any devastation.

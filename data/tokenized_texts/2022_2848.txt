2021 B.V.Pharmaceuticals (PhACs) are considered emerging contaminants with potential accumulation in aquatic organisms.
Thus, seafood consumption may cause long-term effects and health risk for consumers.
In the present study, the occurrence of PhACs in seafood from two Brazilian coastal areas, Sepetiba Bay (n = 43) and Parnaiba Delta River (n = 48), was determined for the first time, and their potential risk for human health was assessed.
An eco-friendly multi-analytes method was used, after being validated for the different types of matrices (mussels, fatty and lean fish).
All compounds under study were detected at least in four seafood species, including chloramphenicol, an antibiotic prohibited in animal foods.
Most PhACs had mean concentrations below limit of quantification.
Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as simvastatin and carbamazepine were the main PhACs bioaccumulated in edible parts of seafood species from Brazil.
The high trophic level carnivorous species, snook, was the most contaminated by NSAIDs, while bivalves were the seafood more contaminated by lipid regulators.
The profile of contamination did not vary among different types of matrix, except in relation to carbamazepine and ketoprofen.
These PhACs were more abundant in species from Sepetiba Bay, an area highly impacted by human influence.
The estimated daily exposure for Brazilian population that consumes the studied species was up to 20.3 ng/kg bw/day via carib pointed-venus and 25.7 ng/kg bw/day via snooks, lower than acceptable daily intake.
Thus, consumption of seafood species from Sepetiba Bay and Parnaiba Delta River seems to be safe to the population in what concerns the PhACs studied.

The beaches of the seaside resorts in the Emilia-Romagna region are of great importance to the regional economy.
During the last decades, certain natural and man-induced developments have created serious problems in the coastal zone primarily related to beach erosion, flood risk of coastal areas and pollution of coastal waters.
The present paper describes results of an identification study carried out by Idroser in cooperation with the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory, which aimed to probe in detail into the various aspects of the coastal problems as to enable the formulation of overall guidelines for future management and development of the Emilia-Romagna coastal zone.

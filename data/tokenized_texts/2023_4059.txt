Abstract: The current state of zoobenthic communities has been studied for lakes Sukkozero and Gimolskoe in the western part of the Republic of Karelia (Muezersky district).
Under conditions of highly colored and low mineralized waters, chironomid larvae, caddisflies, mayflies, and oligochaetes predominate in the communities.
Biomass and abundance ranged within 0.410.75 g/m2 and 315685 ind./m2 in Lake Sukkozero and 0.410.93 g/m2 and 220346 ind./m2 in Lake Gimolskoe in 20172018.
The highest abundance and biomass were noted in the biotopes of silty sediments (overgrown littoral and profundal); the lowest were at the sandy littoral.
According to the quantitative parameters of zoobenthos, Lake Sukkozero was an oligotrophic water body; Lake Gimolskoe was mesotrophic.
Using common biotic indices to assess the ecological quality of waters (indices Mayers, oligochaete, chironomid, and saprobity), it was revealed that low mineralization and high humus content might affect their performance and distort the assessment of real organic pollution.

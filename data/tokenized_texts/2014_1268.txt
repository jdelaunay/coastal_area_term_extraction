Picard coastline of 70 km and in the territory of one department of the Somme.
The morphology of the coast is remarkably varied to such a low linear.
From north to south one another: the Bay of Authie which marks the border with the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the sandy coast hemmed Marquenterre dunes fixed by a pine forest, Somme Bay, the Bas-Champs edged with a shingle and finally the chalk cliffs, initiating the Pays de Caux in Seine-Maritime.
The crossing of the "natural" and "cultural" is essential on this coast where socio-economic issues and social participation are increasingly considered in the management of sections of the Somme.
Faced with the inexorable rise of sea level (GIEC, 2013), the vulnerability of the coastline (especially polder occupied by arable and grassland areas) will increase when the stakes are located directly on the banks of Sea are important.
The time to act is clearly come, it was explained by choices already made between offensive and defensive policies facing the sea.
Human actions can upset the balance between erosion, fattening and coastal stability.
The fringes of the bay are the subject of significant developments issues that pose challenges for decades to come.
Should we continue to "develop this coastline or household"?

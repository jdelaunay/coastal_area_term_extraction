to	O
review	O
how	O

investigate	O
the	O
interactions	O
between	O
groundwater	B

Those	O

divide	O

two	O

which	O
are	O
submarine	B
groundwater	I
discharge	I
and	O
seawater	B
intrusion	I

This	O
investigation	O
is	O
important	O
because	O
the	O
interactions	O
can	O
give	O

The	O

Then	O
in	O
marine	B

it	O
decreases	O

The	O
